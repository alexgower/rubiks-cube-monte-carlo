# Soon:
- Implement recursive ALL neighbour energy function for swap moves too - needed for manual exponential states growth with energy calculation
- Implement turning off parity swap moves


- Add order parameter measurements to relaxed_anneal and history_anneal
- Add saved error logs to relaxed_anneal and history_anneal
# -----

# Later:
- Clean up acceptable_neighbours_graph_plotter code to be less duplicated
- Ask ChatGPT to make code from GitHub more efficient. Use ProfileView again too.
- Optimise p_parity_exchange_swap for speed and effecacy, also ratio of 3-cycles to orientation rotations
- Add ensemble processes

# Maybe:
- Find consistently best relaxation_iterations_vector
- Replace number_of_three_cycle_swap_moves function with mathematical calulation

# For Paper:
- Note I am now using not double-counting-bonds definition of energy not Ollie's definition
- Note Julia and therefore me are using f=1:6 not 0:5 index convention
- Type up 'Rubik's Cube Monte Carlo Supplementary Document' neatly to accomany codebase
