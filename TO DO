# Soon:
- Test history_anneal
- Test thin_funnel_experiment

- Add order parameter measurements to relaxed_anneal and history_anneal
- Add saved error logs to relaxed_anneal and history_anneal


# -----

# Later:
- Ask ChatGPT to make code from GitHub more efficient. Use ProfileView again too.
- Optimise p_parity_exchange_swap for speed and effecacy, also ratio of 3-cycles to orientation rotations
- Add ensemble processes

# Maybe:
- Find consistently best relaxation_iterations_vector

# For Paper:
- Note I am now using not double-counting-bonds definition of energy not Ollie's definition
- Note Julia and therefore me are using f=1:6 not 0:5 index convention
- Type up 'Rubik's Cube Monte Carlo Supplementary Document' neatly to accomany codebase
