# Now:
- Restore bias to 0.35 and subsystem calculation or neraby to speed up if needed
- is statsbase needed swap moves?

- Make neighbour_energy_deltas function part for swap moves
- Automate running distribution and saving histograms

# Soon:
- Add order parameter measurements to relaxed_anneal and history_anneal
- Add saved error logs to relaxed_anneal and history_anneal

- Do configuration_network_degree function part including swap moves
- Later do neighbour_energy_deltas function part for swap moves


# -----

# Later:
- Ask ChatGPT to make code from GitHub more efficient. Use ProfileView again too.
- Optimise p_parity_exchange_swap for speed and effecacy, also ratio of 3-cycles to orientation rotations
- Add ensemble processes

# Maybe:
- Find consistently best relaxation_iterations_vector
- Replace number_of_three_cycle_swap_moves function with mathematical calulation

# For Paper:
- Note I am now using not double-counting-bonds definition of energy not Ollie's definition
- Note Julia and therefore me are using f=1:6 not 0:5 index convention
- Type up 'Rubik's Cube Monte Carlo Supplementary Document' neatly to accomany codebase
